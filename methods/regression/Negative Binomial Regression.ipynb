Rather, current cameras are placed in historically high-collision areas.\n","\n","### Weather and Other Biases:\n","- **Mean Precipitation (`mean_precip`)** has a strong positive effect on collision counts. A **1-unit increase** in precipitation leads to a substantial **increase in collision frequency** (IRR of 2.611), indicating that **rainy conditions** contribute to more collisions.\n","- **Mean Snow (`mean_snow`)** has a negative relationship with collisions, but this is less impactful. The **IRR of -0.483** suggests that snow **reduces collision frequency** slightly, potentially because of reduced speeds during snowy weather.\n","- **Distance to Nearest Camera (`mean_dist_to_camera`)** is positive and significant, meaning that collisions are more likely in areas that are **farther from cameras**, which may indicate **gaps in camera coverage** or that cameras are **concentrated in high-risk areas**.\n","- **Downtown Flag (`downtown`)** has a positive coefficient (IRR of 1.148), meaning that **downtown areas** experience **more collisions** and are likely **overrepresented** in the model, which could skew results.\n","\n","### Implications for Camera Placement:\n","- While cameras currently align with high-risk areas, the large IRR suggests that there are **other high-collision locations with few or no cameras**.\n","- This indicates opportunities to **optimize camera placement** to reduce collisions in under-covered areas.\n","\n","### Coefficient for `camera_count`:\n","0.9537\n","\n","### IRR for `camera_count`:\n","2.595\n","\n","### Conclusion:\n","The model highlights that speed cameras are indeed placed in areas with higher collisions, but there may be **untapped potential** in other **high-risk areas**.\n","- The **IRR value of 2.595** points to a significant effect of camera placement on collision rates, suggesting a need for **strategic relocation** or **additional placement** of cameras in currently **under-served locations**."],"metadata":{"id":"E_UpXCOxIjOt"}}]}
