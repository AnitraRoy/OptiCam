# K-Means Clustering Analysis - Speed Cameras vs Collisions (Toronto)

This folder contains the K-Means clustering analysis for Toronto collision and speed camera data.

**Files included:**
- `K_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full clustering analysis and visualizations.
- `toronto_collision_hotspots.html`: Interactive Folium map showing collision hotspots and existing camera locations.

**Key Insights:**
- Downtown (blue cluster) has the highest number of collisions (≈32%) and the highest collisions-per-camera ratio (~4700), indicating under-enforcement relative to incident volume.
- Suburban clusters have fewer collisions per camera (≈2700–3000), showing more balanced enforcement.
